[![GitHub Actions Status][]][1] [![Translation status from Weblate][]][2] [![Donate][]][3]

*I hate money* is a web application made to ease shared budget
management. It keeps track of who bought what, when, and for whom; and
helps to settle the bills.

-   [Online documentation][]
-   [Hosted version][]
-   [Mailing list][] (to get updates when needed).

The code is distributed under a BSD *beerware* derivative: if you meet
the people in person and you want to pay them a craft beer, you are
highly encouraged to do so.

## Requirements

-   **Python**: version 3.6 to 3.9.
-   **Backends**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MariaDB (version 10.3.2 or above),
    Memory.
